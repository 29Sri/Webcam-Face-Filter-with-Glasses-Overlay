Hi All!!
This Repo contains, my code for the project Webcam Face Filter with Glasses Overlay.
It utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection ( Cascade Classifier) and Overlays the png image of glasses on the detected face using CVzone library.
The code is written in Python programming language.
Pretrained haarcascade model is used to detect the faces.
